- **Backend Framework:** Use Django or Flask for server-side logic.
- **Entities:** Implement models for Admin, Student, Question, Answer, etc.
- **Functionality:** Develop admin interfaces for question input and student interfaces for viewing and answering questions.

### Frontend (Client-Side):
- **Admin Interface:** Design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for question management and evaluation.

- **Static Content:** Host frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) on GitHub Pages or similar for cost-effective deployment.

### Security Considerations:
- Implement robust authentication mechanisms.
- Ensure data safety by validating and sanitizing user inputs.

### Integration with AI Model:
- Depending on the AI model, integrate it into the backend for dynamic question generation.

This setup enables admins to manage educational questions effectively while allowing students to engage with these questions and receive timely feedback from admins.
